Sure! Let's break down each Big O notation with a simple explanation and examples. We'll start with the fastest and move to the slowest:

### 1. **O(1) - Constant Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The operation takes the same amount of time no matter how large the input is.
- **Example:** Imagine you have a list of names, and you want to check the first name. The time it takes is always the same, regardless of the size of the list.
  ```ruby
  def get_first_element(arr)
    arr[0]
  end
  ```

### 2. **O(log N) - Logarithmic Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The operation time increases slowly as the input size grows. This happens when you repeatedly cut the problem in half.
- **Example:** Binary search on a sorted list. If you have 16 items, it only takes 4 steps to find an item.
  ```ruby
  def binary_search(arr, target)
    low, high = 0, arr.length - 1

    while low <= high
      mid = (low + high) / 2
      return mid if arr[mid] == target

      if arr[mid] < target
        low = mid + 1
      else
        high = mid - 1
      end
    end

    nil
  end
  ```

### 3. **O(N) - Linear Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The time taken grows directly in proportion to the input size.
- **Example:** Looping through an array to find a specific item. If there are 10 items, you may have to look at all 10.
  ```ruby
  def find_element(arr, target)
    arr.each do |element|
      return element if element == target
    end
    nil
  end
  ```

### 4. **O(N log N) - N log N Complexity**
- **Explanation:** This is slightly slower than linear but still quite efficient. It often occurs in efficient sorting algorithms.
- **Example:** Merge sort or quicksort.
  ```ruby
  def merge_sort(arr)
    return arr if arr.length <= 1

    mid = arr.length / 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[0...mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid..-1])

    merge(left, right)
  end

  def merge(left, right)
    result = []
    until left.empty? || right.empty?
      result << (left.first <= right.first ? left.shift : right.shift)
    end
    result + left + right
  end
  ```

### 5. **O(n²) - Quadratic Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The time taken grows as the square of the input size. This often happens in nested loops.
- **Example:** A simple bubble sort where you compare every item with every other item.
  ```ruby
  def bubble_sort(arr)
    n = arr.length
    (n - 1).times do
      (0...n - 1).each do |i|
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
          arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
        end
      end
    end
    arr
  end
  ```

### 6. **O(n³) - Cubic Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The time taken grows as the cube of the input size. This occurs with triple nested loops.
- **Example:** Consider a 3D matrix where you need to check every possible combination of three elements.
  ```ruby
  def cubic_example(arr)
    count = 0
    arr.each do |a|
      arr.each do |b|
        arr.each do |c|
          count += 1 if a + b + c == 0
        end
      end
    end
    count
  end
  ```

### 7. **O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The time taken doubles with every additional element. This is very slow and often impractical for large inputs.
- **Example:** Solving the traveling salesman problem with a brute-force approach, or calculating Fibonacci numbers using a simple recursive method.
  ```ruby
  def fibonacci(n)
    return n if n <= 1
    fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
  end
  ```

### 8. **O(N!) - Factorial Complexity**
- **Explanation:** The time taken grows factorially with the input size. This is the slowest and is often used to describe brute-force solutions to problems like permutations.
- **Example:** Generating all possible permutations of a list.
  ```ruby
  def factorial_example(n)
    return [n] if n.length <= 1
    result = []
    n.each_with_index do |element, i|
      rest = n[0...i] + n[i + 1..-1]
      factorial_example(rest).each do |perm|
        result << [element] + perm
      end
    end
    result
  end
  ```

### Summary:
- **O(1):** Fastest, doesn't grow with input size.
- **O(log N):** Grows slowly, good for large inputs.
- **O(N):** Grows proportionally, manageable.
- **O(N log N):** Efficient for sorting large lists.
- **O(n²):** Slower, but okay for small inputs.
- **O(n³):** Even slower, used rarely.
- **O(2ⁿ):** Very slow, often impractical.
- **O(N!):** Slowest, only for very small problems.
